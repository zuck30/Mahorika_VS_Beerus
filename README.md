# Mahoraga & Rika vs Lord Beerus: The Ultimate Adaptation

A JJK-themed battle simulation where the Eight-Handled Sword Divergent Sila Divine General Mahoraga, backed by the Queen of Curses Rika, faces off against the God of Destruction, Beerus.

## 🌌 The Premise

Beerus has arrived to erase a "peculiar anomaly" in the Jujutsu world. Mahoraga, summoned and reinforced by Rika's infinite Cursed Energy, must adapt to the concept of Destruction itself before being completely erased.

## ⚔️ Game Mechanics

### Beerus (God of Destruction)
- **Divine Energy:** Beerus's "Health". If he exhausts his energy or is somehow overwhelmed, the battle ends.
- **Hakai (Erasure):** Beerus's primary tool. It deals massive damage initially, but its effectiveness drops as Mahoraga adapts to the phenomenon.
- **Hakai Attempts:** Every time Beerus uses Hakai, Mahoraga's wheel turns, accelerating his adaptation.

### Mahoraga & Rika (The Zenin Trump Card)
- **HP:** Mahoraga's physical integrity. If it reaches 0, he is erased.
- **Adaptation Progress:** A percentage indicating how much Mahoraga has adapted to Beerus's techniques. At 100%, Mahoraga becomes immune to erasure.
- **Sustain Flow:** Rika channels Cursed Energy to heal Mahoraga, allowing him to survive longer to complete his adaptation.
- **Accelerate Adaptation:** Mahoraga focuses solely on the wheel, increasing adaptation progress at the cost of vulnerability.
