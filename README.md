## The Premise

Lord Beerus, the God of Destruction, detects a "peculiar anomaly" in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe - an entity capable of adapting to any and all phenomena. Intrigued and threatened, Beerus arrives to erase this anomaly. Meanwhile, Mahoraga, the Eight-Handled Sword Divergent Sila Divine General, is summoned and reinforced by Rika's infinite Cursed Energy. The stage is set for a battle that questions the very concepts of destruction and adaptation.

## Battle Mechanics

### Beerus (God of Destruction)
- **Divine Energy Pool**: Beerus's life force. If depleted or overwhelmed, the battle ends.
- **Hakai (Erasure)**: Beerus's ultimate technique that erases targets from existence. Effectiveness decreases as Mahoraga adapts.
- **Destruction Meter**: Each Hakai attempt accelerates Mahoraga's adaptation through the wheel's rotation.

### Mahoraga & Rika (The Adaptation Duo)
- **Physical Integrity (HP)**: Mahoraga's existence stability. Reaching 0 means complete erasure.
- **Adaptation Progress**: Percentage tracking adaptation to Hakai. At 100%, Mahoraga becomes immune to erasure.
- **Cursed Energy Flow**: Rika channels infinite energy to sustain Mahoraga, healing damage over time.
- **Adaptation Focus**: Mahoraga can prioritize wheel rotation over defense, increasing vulnerability for faster adaptation.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zuck30/Mahorika_VS_Beerus.git
   cd Mahorika_VS_Beerus
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

4. **Open Your Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to begin the battle!

### Alternative Setup with Vite
If you prefer Vite for faster development:
```bash
npm run dev
# The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
```

## How to Play

1. **Start the Battle**: Click "Begin Battle" to initialize the confrontation
2. **Observe Mechanics**: Watch as Beerus uses Hakai and Mahoraga's wheel turns
3. **Control Adaptation**: Use the control panel to:
   - Sustain Mahoraga with Rika's energy
   - Accelerate adaptation (but become more vulnerable)
   - Monitor adaptation progress and health
4. **Victory Conditions**:
   - Mahoraga wins if adaptation reaches 100%
   - Beerus wins if Mahoraga's HP reaches 0

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
npx kill-port 3000
# Restart the application
npm start
```

**Missing Dependencies**
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**TypeScript Errors**
